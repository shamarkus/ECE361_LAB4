The two additional features that we chose to implement are private messaging and user registration. 

To private message a user you run the command /pm <user> <message>. This will display [PRIVATE] sender: <message> on both the
 sender's and reciever's screen. It will not print anything on the serverside or on the client side of other users. You cannot
 private message yourself, you cannot private message someone who is not registered and you cannot private message someone who
 is not logged in.

User registration is managed by a text file called users.txt:
When you run the command /createuser <username> <password> <server_ip> <port_number>, your username and password
will be added to a new row in the text file. You cannot create a new user when logged in and you cannot create two
users with the same username. The file is update dynamically so that even when you restart the server user info is maintained
